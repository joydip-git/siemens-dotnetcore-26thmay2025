agenda: to implement the concept of class, its data members, methods, properties, constructors, create instance of class, access members etc.

payroll application:
this application is used to calculate salary of different types of employees of an organization, for example, currently developers.

A. create a blank solution: PayrollApp

B. Library app: add a new library project in the same solution, named: PayrollApp.Entities

Add a class file: Developer.cs with a class inside it: Developer

Developer class structure:
	Data Members:
		id (int) -> should be assigned ONLY through constructor [use readonly keyword with data member]
		name (string)
		basicPay (decimal)
		daPay (decimal)
		hraPay (decimal)
		incentivePay (decimal)
		totalPay (decimal) -> will be set by a method, will NOT be passed from outside the class

	Constructors:
		default ctor
		parameterized ctor -> will assign value to all data members, except the "totalPay"
	
	Properties:
		Id for id -> readonly property
		Name for name
		BasicPay for basicPay
		DaPay for daPay
		HraPay for hraPay
		IncentivePay for incentivePay
		TotalPay for totalPay -> readonly property
		
	Functionalities:
		CalculateSalary: calculates the total salary (simply add the salary parts) and assigns the same to the totalPay 
			arguments: NA
			return value: void



C. Console App: Add a new console app in the solution, named: PayrollApp.UserInterface

add reference to the PayrollApp.Entities library project

in the [Main method of Program class in] Program.cs, create at least one object of the class and assign the values to the data members. Then calculate the total pay and then print the same.

Note: 
	1. accept all the values from user
	2. do not create instance of the Developer class in the Main method. Create the object in separate method. the method will create the instance and return the instance to the Main method. the method will be called from Main method.
	3. In the main method you will calculate the total pay and print the same

Enhancement:
--------------------------

Library: PayrollApp.Entities
Add a class file: Hr.cs with a class inside it: Hr

Developer class structure:
	Data Members:
		id (int) -> should be assigned ONLY through constructor [use readonly keyword with data member]
		name (string)
		basicPay (decimal)
		daPay (decimal)
		hraPay (decimal)
		gratuityPay (decimal)
		totalPay (decimal) -> will be set by a method, will NOT be passed from outside the class

	Constructors:
		default ctor
		parameterized ctor -> will assign value to all data members, except the "totalPay"
	
	Properties:
		Id for id -> readonly property
		Name for name
		BasicPay for basicPay
		DaPay for daPay
		HraPay for hraPay
		GratuityPay for gratuityPay
		TotalPay for totalPay -> readonly property
		
	Functionalities:
		CalculateSalary: calculates the total salary (simply add the salary parts) and assigns the same to the totalPay 
			arguments: NA
			return value: void

Console App: PayRollApp.UserInterface
1. create an array to store references of both Developer and Hr class instances after asking the size of the array from user
2. create nultiple instances of Developer and Hr class and save them in the array
	2.a. before creating any instance ask user about which type of instance to create [provide a menu]
	2.b. now create that type of instance and while doing that ask every piece of value from user
	2.c. save the instance into the array
3. Iterate through the array and pick up reference of every instance and display - name, id and total salary of everyone
