[matrix arrray: number of rows and columns are identical]

create a console application, where given a two dimensional odd-numered matrix array [n*n, where n%2!=0], produce a single dimensional array, where the value will be copied from the matrix array in the following fashion in the sigle dimensional arry:
a. lowest value of matrix array should be placed at the middle index position of the single dimensional array
b. then in a left to right fashion, the next highest values should be organized.
means: next highest goes to the left of the middle and the subsequent next highest value should be placed at the right side of the middle index

Example: 
two dim matrix array: 3*3
[
	0 -> 50,20,30,
	1 -> 10,40,90,
	2 -> 70,60,80
]

produce a single dimensional array with the values from two dimensional array organized in the following manner (let-right)

	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[	80	60	40	20	10	30	50	70	90	]

1. create console application
2. in the Main method
	- create two dimensional odd-numbered matrix array, where the size of the array is accepted from user
	- then accept the values also from user to be stored in the matrix array
	- then write the logic to complete the application


you should not write entire logic in Main methd (No top-level statement) or entire code as top-level statement. create separate methods for separate task.
